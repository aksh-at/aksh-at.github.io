I work at [Scale AI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshat-bubna-188885103/) where I do various engineering, product and operations things.

Recently, I've been building in Haskell, reading fiction and cultural theory, and attempting to write sentences no one else has written before. A long time ago I did programming competitions.

Note: [my cat is known to post half-baked Nietzschean aphorisms to the Internet](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFYkDzHHrrH/); I do not endorse his views in any way.
