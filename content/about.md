I'm a software engineer interested in languages (programming and otherwise), philosophy, and fiction (and also the intersection of the 3, which is essentially the collected works of one [Jorge Luis Borges](https://www.amazon.com/Ficciones-Jorge-Luis-Borges/dp/0802130305)).

Currently, I'm working on a startup building serverless data stuff. Before that I was engineer #8 at [Scale AI](http://scale.com/) where I did various engineering, product and operations things. A long time ago I did [programming competitions](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/3063).

Note: [my cat is known to post half-baked Nietzschean aphorisms to the Internet](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFYkDzHHrrH/); his views are his own.
