      <description>I work at Scale AI where I do various engineering, product and operations things.
Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been building in Haskell, reading fiction and cultural theory, and attempting to write sentences no one else has written before. A long time ago I did programming competitions.
Note: my cat is known to post half-baked Nietzschean aphorisms to the Internet; I do not endorse his views in any way.</description>

      <description>It is a little known fact that the airport of a small, smoky city in Southeast Asia has more licensed therapists in one building than anywhere else in the worldâ€”for the transition from the pristine terminal to the poverty outside can be so traumatic, that the city provides free counseling and a shot of morphine for any outsiders spending a night in the city.
Travelers are required to take the drugs before they leave the airport, but if you desire an undiluted experience of the cough-syrup colored haze, there is a way to opt out.</description>
