      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer interested in languages (programming and otherwise), philosophy, and fiction (and also the intersection of the 3, which is essentially the collected works of one Jorge Luis Borges).
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working on a startup building serverless data stuff. Before that I was engineer #8 at Scale AI where I did various engineering, product and operations things. A long time ago I did programming competitions.
Note: my cat is known to post half-baked Nietzschean aphorisms to the Internet; his views are his own.</description>

      <description>It is a little known fact that the airport of a small, smoky city in Southeast Asia has more licensed therapists in one building than anywhere else in the worldâ€”for the transition from the pristine terminal to the poverty outside can be so traumatic, that the city provides free counseling and a shot of morphine for any outsiders spending a night in the city.
Travelers are required to take the drugs before they leave the airport, but if you desire an undiluted experience of the cough-syrup colored haze, there is a way to opt out.</description>
