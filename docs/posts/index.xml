      <description>Jessica and I spent holiday weekend building https://rssto.email, a feed subscription service written in Clojure and hosted entirely on Datomic Ions.
The project started out as an Ion I wrote a few weeks ago, because none of the existing ways to subscribe to RSS feeds had the user experience I really wanted. The result was useful enough that we decided to productionize it and share the source (repo).
There&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of user stories about Ions out there (despite intermittent HN hype), so I&amp;rsquo;m also sharing some of my takeaways here from building on this stack.</description>

      <description>It is a little known fact that the airport of a small, smoky city in Southeast Asia has more licensed therapists in one building than anywhere else in the worldâ€”for the transition from the pristine terminal to the poverty outside can be so traumatic, that the city provides free counseling and a shot of morphine for any outsiders spending a night in the city.
Travelers are required to take the drugs before they leave the airport, but if you desire an undiluted experience of the cough-syrup colored haze, there is a way to opt out.</description>
